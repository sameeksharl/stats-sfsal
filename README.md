# Stats-SFSAL


## Abstract:

The research conducted, models different parts of the salaries of various job titles in the city
of San Francisco. For example, you may compare different aspects of the salary of a police
officer and a member in the fire department. This may be in terms of the base pay, the
benefits, the overtime pay or any of the other available categories. The aim of this research
has been to simplify the data given in the dataset by graphically plotting and comparing these
salaries for different job titles such that it becomes easier to understand this data. This would
be useful for someone living in San Francisco to make a decision about their job or for
someone planning to move to San Francisco for job prospects. We start off with cleaning the
data. The columns with over 70% of the values being NaN were removed. The NaN values of
some columns were replaced by the mean after grouping by job title, some rows with specific
strings and NaN values were removed. The processed data is then analyzed and visualized
using some visualized using some visual aids. Histograms, bar graphs, box plots and scatter
plots are used to aptly visualize the data and interpret it efficiently. A null hypothesis and
alternate hypothesis was assumed and by performing a z-test, the null hypothesis was seen to
be plausible. It has also been seen that every column is positively correlated with each other.

## Introduction

If you were to live in a big city like San Francisco, you would probably analyze many
different things about the city and one of the primary analyses that needs to be done is that of
the jobs that you may be able to take up in the city. This is of primary concern as the location
of your house, place where you buy all the necessary items for your house and your general
standard of life depends on the amount of wealth you are able to accumulate which would
primarily be through your job. We believe that there is a necessity to analyze this data to
understand which jobs are better in different respects and analyze the numerical columns to
realize which jobs are better in all the different respects. Our research analyzes the salary
details of different jobs across the city of San Francisco to generally evaluate the living
standard of different people across and to optimize these values. We also grouped the jobs by
profession and calculated the highest paying jobs among professions given in our dataset.
